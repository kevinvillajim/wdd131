				<h2>Alma 26:22</h2>
				<p>
					Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth faith, and bringeth forth good
					works, and prayeth continually without ceasingâ€”unto such it is given
					to know the mysteries of God; yea, unto such it shall be given to
					reveal things which never have been revealed; yea, and it shall be
					given unto such to bring thousands of souls to repentance, even as it
					has been given unto us to bring these our brethren to repentance.

				<h2>Helaman 5:12</h2>
				<p>
					And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our
					Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your
					foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds,
					yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his
					mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to
					drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the
					rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation
					whereon if men build they cannot fall.
